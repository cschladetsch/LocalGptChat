# Interact with OpenAI's GPT LLM from Command Line

You will need your own OpenAI key in a local file called 'key'.

Code snippets are written to local disk. That's the main feature. I'll think about the converse: how to get local code into a browser.


## TODO

Simplify getting local code into a browser. Even if it means platform-specific code.
