# Interact with OpenAI's GPT LLM from Command Line

You will need your own OpenAI key in a local file called 'key'.

All input and outut is written to 'log.txt'

Code snippets are written to local disk. That's the main feature. I'll think about the converse: how to get local code into a brwoser.


## TODO

Extract code and write to local file.
